Javascript-Lesson-Learned

-- Summary for each lesson
## Lesson 1: Variables
Just a box to contain our data/value in it (Example: 01-variable.html)

## Lesson 2: Data Types
Quick look at first: talk about basic variable's type like: String, Boolean, ....
There are 2 data's type: NULL and UNDEFINIED
1. null: value is empty or value is not existed
2. undefined: for the variable had been declared but haven't define value for it
==> null is declared and undefined is not
==> null != undefined (example from 02-datatype.html) but level null == undefined
==> null type is object and undefined type is undefined

## Lesson 3: Array
Follow 03-array.html is enough

## Lesson 4.1: Create a function and init into html file
Follow 04-function folder is enough
===> This is very simple, call method outside and init into main project (Make code cleaner and easy to track when working with many features with different methods)

## Lesson 4.2: Anonymous Function and Arrow Function
Common: use to declare a function
Anonymous Function: when calling at the time that we want
Arrow Function: fast declaration on method

## Lesson 5: Objects
- Object is something like human for example, it will include with these definition (gender, name, etc)
- Had learnt how to define in JS and how to log it out and use it

## Lesson 6: Classes
- Basic programming's knowledge
- Think of this: many objects with the same value => Class will help it => Just call it when need to use

## Lesson 7: Conditional
- If Else only

## Lesson 8: Complex Conditional
- Still If Else but a litte bit math in it (follow 08-complex-conditional folder to more information)

## Lesson 9: Loop basic (Using For)
- Simple loop using For

## Lesson 10: Loop forever (While and Do While)
- Follow 10-loop-forever
