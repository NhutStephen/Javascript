Javascript-Lesson-Learned

-- Summary for each lesson
## Lesson 1: Variables
Just a box to contain our data/value in it (Example: 01-variable.html)

## Lesson 2: Data Types
Quick look at first: talk about basic variable's type like: String, Boolean, ....
There are 2 data's type: NULL and UNDEFINIED
1. null: value is empty or value is not existed
2. undefined: for the variable had been declared but haven't define value for it
==> null is declared and undefined is not
==> null != undefined (example from 02-datatype.html) but level null == undefined
==> null type is object and undefined type is undefined
===> I think people would use null to clear value (most purpose???)

## Lesson 3: Array
Follow 03-array.html is enough

## Lesson 4: Create a function and init into html file
Follow 04-function folder is enough
===> This is very simple, call method outside and init into main project (Make code cleaner and easy to track when working with many features with different methods)

## Lesson 5: Anonymous Function and Arrow Function
Common: use to declare a function
Anonymous Function: question in here is: when do we use it (answer for why too)
Arrow Function: ^

## Lesson 6: Objects
- Object is something like human for example, it will include with these definition (gender, name, etc)
- Had learnt how to define in JS and how to log it out and use it
