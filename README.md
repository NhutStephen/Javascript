-- Summary for each lesson
## Lesson 1: Variables
Just a box to contain our data/value in it (Example: 01-variable.html)

## Lesson 2: Data Types
Quick look at first: talk about basic variable's type like: String, Boolean, ....
There are 2 data's type: NULL and UNDEFINIED
1. null: value is empty or value is not existed
2. undefined: for the variable had been declared but haven't define value for it
==> null is declared and undefined is not
==> null != undefined (example from 02-datatype.html) but level null == undefined
